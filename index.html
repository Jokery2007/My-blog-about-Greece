<h1>Part 1</h1>
<section class="a">
    Greece is not like Poland. <br>
     I can't go by car from the beginning to the end of Greece. <br>
      Why? Because it's the Islands!
</section>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<section class="a">
    My favorite island is Rhodos. <br>
     But Crete is bigger than that, making it the 5th largest island in the world! <br> 
    I think this is the most attractive island.
</section>
<h3>Part 3</h3>
<section class="a">
    I know it's the same in practice, but. There are a lot of mountains in Crete. <br>
     She is just recognizable thanks to the large <br> 
     number of mountains and beautiful seas.
</section>
<h4>Part 4</h4>
<section class="a">
    In Greece, Kos is a tiny island belonging <br>
     to the Dodakenez archipelago. 25,000 inhabitants. <br>
     It is here that the oldest medical school, Askepiejon, <br>
      is located, where young Greeks learned the secrets of the medical art.
